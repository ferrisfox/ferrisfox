## Greetings internet I am Ferris, somtimes Fox

I mostly write Rust code.
You can also relly on me for cybersecurity and settingup small networks.

Love learning new things.
Have probably dabbled in a few too many esolangs.

Working on releasing a [brocade.io](https://www.brocade.io/) library for rust and a game engine (also in rust, but based an [Hazel tutorials](https://thecherno.com/engine)).
